# Deep Learning Credit Scoring with TensorFlow

This project explores **deep learning techniques** for **credit scoring** using **TensorFlow**. It is divided into two parts:

1. **Understanding TensorFlow fundamentals** by building and training a **neural network from scratch**.
2. **Applying deep learning to predict credit scores** using **real-world data**.

Through **variable initialization, session management, and model optimization**, this project builds a **strong foundation in deep learning** for financial risk assessment.
